# ECE C143, Spring 2023 with Dr. Jonathan Kao

Homework 4:

Probabilistic machine learning to discretely classify neural data into three discrete positions in space.
1. Rigorously deriving machine learning model parameters [3 probabilistic models: Gaussian Normal (class agnostic covariance), Gaussian Normal (class specific covariance), Poisson].
2. Implementing said parameters using numpy and matplotlib to train our model based on given data, then classify test data. Gaussian Normal (class agnostic cov) achieved 96% accuracy.

Homework 6:

Implementing OLE, Wiener, and Kalman filters on neural data to continuously decode the position of the monkey's hand in space. Applications include creating continuous cursor control using a brain-computer-interface (BCI).
