# ECE C143, Spring 2023 with Dr. Jonathan Kao

Homework 4: By far the coolest so far. 
1. Rigorously deriving machine learning model parameters [3 probabilistic models: Gaussian Normal (class agnostic covariance), Gaussian Normal (class specific covariance), Poisson].
2. Implementing said parameters using numpy and matplotlib to train our model based on given data, then classify test data. Gaussian Normal (class agnostic cov) achieved 96% accuracy.
